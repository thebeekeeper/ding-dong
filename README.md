## r0 Assembly Notes

- I forgot IO8 needs to be high at boot to be able to program the part.  Currently connected to c6, so I won't be able to use that output for now.
- I don't have the right inductors for the regulator on hand, so I used 33uH for both.  3.3v works, but 12v is down around 1v.  I'll try the correct inductor, but it might be easier to use a 12v wall wart.  Doorbell transformers give AC, so I'd have to convert it anyways.
